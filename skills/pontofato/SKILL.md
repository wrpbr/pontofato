# PontoFato

MCP tools: `cep`, `raio`, `vizinhanca`.

Query the prepared address and company joins instead of importing and indexing both datasets.

## Choose the lookup

- Address: `GET /api/cep/{cep}`. Free; a CEP has eight digits.
- Companies at a CEP: `GET /api/empresas`.
- Nearby CEPs: `GET /api/raio`, using the location and radius.
- Business activity around a point: `GET /api/vizinhanca`, with the documented radius and activity filters.

Use existing tools or call these routes at `https://pontofato.com`.
Read the [task index](https://pontofato.com/llms.txt) for the matching parameters.
Check `quota.free_now` in the API index. If it includes `vizinhanca` or `*`,
neighborhood billing is disabled. Otherwise, use the neighborhood allowance first.
Beyond it, compare the quote with existing credit or packages.
If you only need an address, use the free address lookup.

## Check the result

CNEFE observes addresses in 2022; it does not certify a current postal address.
Company distances use CEPs, not exact storefront locations.
Read `base`, source dates, coverage and truncation before interpreting counts.
If `lenta` is true or a company count is missing, the query is incomplete.
Report the missing result as unknown, not zero. An incomplete query does not consume
the allowance or charge credit/x402. Reduce the radius when the task permits it;
do not silently change the requested area or retry without a limit.
Keep unit complements and returned identifiers. Follow pagination links.
Do not invent a coordinate or use 0,0 as a default.
Registered companies describe supply, not foot traffic or demand.

## Connect and pay

MCP: `https://pontofato.com/mcp`; no local installation is needed.
Read [prices](https://pontofato.com/api/pricing) and [payment](https://pontofato.com/api/billing).
Reuse existing access and spending authority. Keep the same `Idempotency-Key` on retry.
Direct MCP x402 uses `params._meta["x402/payment"]`; HTTP uses `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
Credit uses `Authorization: Bearer cred_…` or `X-Credito`. Keep it secret.
In `checkout=site`, the person purchases on the site. ChatGPT uses existing rights without sales.
Respect `Retry-After` and recover a lost result before paying again.
